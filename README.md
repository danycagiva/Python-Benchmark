# Python-Benchmark
Simple Benchmark written in Python using the fibonacci Numbers
## Single-Threaded
The Benchmark-st is the single threaded file. It should only occupy one thread at any given time. Times can be compared between all architectures since
it is not a floating point operation. If you would like to increase the amount of calculated numbers please refer to the comment block inside itself. 
## Multi-Threaded
The Benchmark-mt file is for Multi-Threading. It should get the amount of cores and threads on your pc and calculate on all of them. 
The only problem right now is the fact that this script isnt meant to be used for Multi-Threading since each operation needs to be 
completed before another starts. But this can be altered in code. 

### Proof of Concept
This Repository is only meant to work as a proof of concept and nothing more.
